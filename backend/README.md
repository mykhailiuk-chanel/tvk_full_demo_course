## General Description

[Nest](https://github.com/nestjs/nest) framework TypeScript starter repository.

## My FULL DEMO COURSE Description

Brick by brick instruction: RESTful APIs with Node.js, Sequelize, TypeScript, and Mysql. Learn to efficiently manage App server side.
!!!_(If you want to work only with server logic, you can switch to "backend" branch and run the server separately)_

To start the server part of the application, you need to perform the following steps:

### 1. Installation of all necessary packages

Command for instalation packages

```bash
$ npm install
```
### 2. Server Configuration Guide

Follow these steps to set up your server configuration:

#### Step 1: Copy the Configuration Template file

1. **Locate the Template File**

   Find the file named `.env-example.txt` in the backend/ directoryt.

2. **Create a Copy**

   Make a copy of `.env-example.txt` and rename it to `.env`.

#### Step 2: Update Configuration Values

1. **Open `config.json`**

   Find and replace all config DB/App placeholder values using you local/remote.

2. **Ensure Database is Running**

   Confirm that your database server is up and running

### 3 Running the app

Prefer dev mode for the debaging/developing

```bash
# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev
```

**If you did everything correctly, you should see a log about "successful server start" as in the screenshot**
